  <h1>Luke Smith is alive</h1>

<img src="Luke smith.png" alt="How Luke appeared to me in a dream" >

<p>My reaction to seeing Lenin coming back alive would be bad. 
  I’d be screaming for somebody to give me a taser gun so I can subdue and torture him for eternity. 
  Thank god there is no one way to torture information out of a man. 
  Waterboarding, sound blasting, sleep deprivation and so on. 
  This one is a Lenin but only in form, I swear to god he is the spitting image of Lenin. He’s actually the opposite of Lenin.
  He is Luke Smith.</p>

<p>> orthodox Catholic monk?</p>
<p>> The "Linux guy"</p>
<p>> Fellow HTML Fundamentalist</p>
<p>> Web bloat crusader</p>
<p>> Classical Latin enjoyer</p>
<p>> Hates roads for some reason</p>
<p>> Lives in the middle of the woods</p>
<p>> Hardcore Libertarian(The American kind; the only kind there is)</p>
<p>> Phd student in Linguistics</p>

<P>He fell off the internet randomly one day and his last video was about him travelling to Eastern Europe. 
  He was not heard from since. 
  UNTIL… He just starts posting on youtube again like nothing happened.</P>

<p>He is weird. But he did open my mind to a lot of things out there that I didn’t know about. </p>

<h2>Luke introduced me to Latin</h2>

<p>You mean I can literally learn a language that most people don’t? that is like super niche??? Count me in. 
  Bonus point– A thousand years of wisdom gets unlocked in a year or two of serious effort into learning Classical Latin.</p>

<p>For the haters saying most of that stuff has already been translated into english, I have only two things to say:</p>

<p>A--  Mastering an ancient language(especially a dead one) requires you to read ancient texts. Lindy stuff. 
  Which most people anyway wouldn’t cause no incentive.</p>

<p>B-- Imagine reading Premchand in English. Absolute goy move. </p>

<p>Luke obviously has a no-fluff no-bullshit roadmap that really got me into linguistics in general and Latin in particular.

<h2>Linux for normies</h2>

<p>I’m not a tech guy. Not even remotely. I’m known to be something of a luddite in that regard cause I mostly read philosophy, literature and history and the occasional political and defense commentary. 
  from the perspective of formal education, I’ve not touched anything related to tech or even math. 
  I’m bad at it, perhaps don’t have the bandwidth for those levels of abstract thinking. 
  Massive respect for those who do.</p>

<p>There are these old videos of Luke the yt algo randomly pushes on my feed about ricing arch linux or how to install arch(savage edition) or something like setting up an RSS feed and an email server. 
  Watched the ‘how to use Hugo(static site generator)’ from beginning to end and even took notes. 
  I have never taken notes from a yt video before. I sure learn new things about myself everyday. Very esoteric stuff. 
  And I don’t know if this is common knowledge in dev circles but I found it pretty damn cool. </p>

<p>Sudo apt install Linux arc where I tried to install Arch(unsuccessfully at first) for 3 days. 
  I couldn’t figure out what ‘mounting’ means. 
  Absolute frustrating experience. But I gained a shit ton of information + motivation to dig more into the linux rabbit hole.  
  All thanks to the bald soviet professor. </p>
